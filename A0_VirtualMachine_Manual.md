Your final configuration should resemble the image given above if using VMWare.

### Please ensure that your hostname is your SRN in lower case.

For VirtualBox users, refer to the image below for the final configuration summary.

## Step 3 - Optional - for VirtualBox users

Since VirtualBox does not allow the user to pre configure the hostname as well as the password before provisioning the VM, the user will have to manually add their hostname as well as password during the Ubuntu setup screen.
